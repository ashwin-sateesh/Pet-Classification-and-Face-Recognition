# Pet-Classification-and-Face-Recognition

Constructed convolutional neural nets with VGGNet based architecture for classification of cats and dogs, and built a custom face detection model by applying bounding box augmentation to detect cats and dogs in real time with the help of YOLOv5 (now updated to yolov7)
